-- In order to use this Lua plugin you must deploy the following database
-- schema and grant the user configured above with the required privileges:
--[[ 
  CREATE EXTENSION pgcrypto;
  CREATE TABLE vmq_auth_acl
  (
    mountpoint character varying(10) NOT NULL,
    client_id character varying(128) NOT NULL,
    username character varying(128) NOT NULL,
    password character varying(128),
    publish_acl json,
    subscribe_acl json,
    CONSTRAINT vmq_auth_acl_primary_key PRIMARY KEY (mountpoint, client_id, username)
  );
]]--
-- This plugin relies on a PostgreSQL version that supports the `gen_salt('bf')
-- built-in function, as the passwords are stored as blowfish hashes.
-- Moreover the json datatype is used for storing the publish/subscribe ACLs.
--
-- To insert a client ACL use a similar SQL statement:
--[[
  WITH x AS (
      SELECT
          ''::text AS mountpoint,
  	       'test-client'::text AS client_id,
  	       'test-user'::text AS username,
  	       '123'::text AS password,
  	       gen_salt('bf')::text AS salt,
  	       '[{"pattern": "a/b/c"}, {"pattern": "c/b/#"}]'::json AS publish_acl,
  	       '[{"pattern": "a/b/c"}, {"pattern": "c/b/#"}]'::json AS subscribe_acl
  	) 
  INSERT INTO vmq_auth_acl (mountpoint, client_id, username, password, publish_acl, subscribe_acl)
  	SELECT 
  		x.mountpoint,
  		x.client_id,
  		x.username,
  		crypt(x.password, x.salt),
  		publish_acl,
  		subscribe_acl

-- 	The JSON array passed as publish/subscribe ACL contains the ACL objects
-- 	this particular user. MQTT wildcards as well as the variable
